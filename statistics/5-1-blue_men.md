[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

A male in the united states with a height of 5'10 falls in the 49th percentille of the male population, one with a height of 6'1" falls in the 83rd percentile of the poulation.
By subtracting these two values we find that 34% of the US male population would be elligable based on height to be a member of the blue man group.  Unfortunately rhythm is not quantified in this dataset as I expect the number of elligable blue men would be decreased significantly.
