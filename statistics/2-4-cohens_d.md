[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Results:
I ran the following calculations:
mean weight accross all pregnancies(lbs): 7.265628457623368
firstborns mean wight(lbs): 7.201094430437772
non-firstborn mean weight(lbs): 7.325855614973262
diffrence in mean weight first to non first(lbs): -0.017171423678372415
cohens d, first born to non firstborn(std deviations): -0.088672927072602

The effect size of first pregnancy weight to non-first pregnancy weight came out to -0.089.  Because it is negative, this tells us that the mean weight of firstborns trends slightly lower than non-firstborns. The extent of this trend is interesting given that we had already established that first borns tend to gestate for slightly longer.  One would expect a longer gestation to be correlated with a higher birth weight, but this shows that is not necessarily the case.  It's important to note that even though the effect on weight is a stronger one than we saw on length of pregnancy,  it is still a very small effect.  It falls into line with our previous discoveries about birthorders effect on the baby. Minimal at best.
