[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The random.random function appears to do a pretty consistent job of generating truly random samples.  I created graphs of both the cdf an pmf distributions and ran the sample several times over.  Each time there was some very slight banding in the pmf indicating some clustering, and where that banding existed on the histogram the cdf step plot showed some deviation from a perfectly straight line.  The banding or deviation was never pronounced, and occured at varying locations in the distribution.  as an experiment I played around with the sample size to see what effect that had on the distributions.  When I increased the sample size to 10,000 and later to 50,000 the cdf was dead straight, no deviation was detectable, and with an adequately small line size you could only discern the slightes hint of banding within the pmf.  when the sample size was decreased to 100 the opposit effect occured as one would expect, but I beleive this speaks more to the importance of having adequately large samples than anything.  I beleive it's safe to conclude from these tests that the samples produced by random.random, while not perfect are are adequately close to being truly random.
